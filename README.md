## Project Overview  
This project is a *uniform customization and ordering application* designed for both *companies and individuals*.  
The platform allows users to:  
- Select from ready-made design templates.  
- Customize designs with their own colors, logos, or text.  
- Specify the required quantities.  
- Complete secure online payments directly through the app.  

The application acts as a *marketplace/mediator*, connecting customers (businesses or individuals) with trusted suppliers who handle production and delivery.  
This ensures a smooth, transparent, and reliable ordering experience.
